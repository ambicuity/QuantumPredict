QuantumPredict
QuantumPredict is a Python-based project that uses quantum computing principles to train and evaluate a predictive model. The model is trained on a classical dataset and then evaluated to determine its accuracy.

Code Snippet
Here is a brief snippet from our main implementation:

# Train classical model
quantum_predictor.train_classical_model(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = quantum_predictor.evaluate_model(X_test, y_test)

print(f"QuantumPredict Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

In this snippet, we first train our model using the train_classical_model method, which takes in training data X_train and y_train. After training, we evaluate the model using the evaluate_model method with test data X_test and y_test. The accuracy of the model is then printed to the console.

Getting Started
To use this project, you will need to have a Python environment set up. You will also need to install any dependencies, which can be found in the requirements.txt file.

Once you have the environment set up, you can run the main implementation file to train and evaluate the model.
